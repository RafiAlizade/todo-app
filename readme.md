# TodoApp Project

Welcome to the TodoApp project! This simple yet powerful application allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Whether you need to keep track of your work assignments or just your personal chores, TodoApp is here to help.

## Features

TodoApp comes with a range of features designed to make your task management seamless and straightforward:

- **Add Todos:** Easily add new tasks to your list. Just type in your task and hit the add button to see it appear in your todo list.
- **Delete Todos:** Made a mistake or completed a task? Remove any todo from your list with just a click on the delete icon next to the task.
- **Delete All Todos:** Overwhelmed by too many tasks or need to start fresh? Our "Delete All" feature allows you to clear your entire list, giving you a clean slate in seconds.

## Upcoming Features

We are constantly working to improve TodoApp and make it more beneficial for our users. Here are some of the features you can look forward to in future updates:

- **Search Functionality:** Soon, you'll be able to quickly search through your tasks, making it easier to find and manage specific todos.
